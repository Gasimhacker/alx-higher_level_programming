#0x01-python-if_else_loops_functions 
 This directory contains a collection of Python scripts that focus on topics such as conditional statements, loops, and functions. Each script addresses a specific task or problem to be solved. Here's a brief description of the tasks within this directory:

1. 0-positive_or_negative.py: This script generates a random number and determines whether it is positive, negative, or zero.

2. 1-last_digit.py: The purpose of this script is to find and print the last digit of a given number.

3. 2-print_alphabet.py: This script prints the English alphabet in lowercase.

4. 3-print_alphabt.py: Similar to the previous script, this one also prints the English alphabet in lowercase but excludes the letters 'q' and 'e'.

5. 4-print_hexa.py: The goal of this script is to print all numbers from 0 to 98 in decimal and hexadecimal format.

6. 5-print_comb2.py: This script prints combinations of two-digit numbers without repetition.

7. 6-print_comb3.py: Similar to the previous script, this one prints combinations of three-digit numbers without repetition.

8. 7-islower.py: This script defines a function that checks if a given character is a lowercase letter.

9. 8-uppercase.py: The purpose of this script is to convert a string to uppercase.

10. 9-print_last_digit.py: This script defines a function that prints the last digit of a given number.

11. 10-add.py: This script defines a function that adds two integers and returns the result.

12. 11-pow.py: The goal of this script is to define a function that computes the power of a number.

13. 12-fizzbuzz.py: This script implements the FizzBuzz game, where it prints numbers from 1 to 100, replacing multiples of 3 with "Fizz," multiples of 5 with "Buzz," and multiples of both 3 and 5 with "FizzBuzz."

14. 13-insert_number.c: This task involves a C program that inserts a number into a sorted singly linked list.

15. 100-print_tebahpla.py: Similar to 2-print_alphabet.py, this script prints the English alphabet in reverse order, from 'z' to 'a'.

16. 101-remove_char_at.py: This script defines a function that removes a character at a specific position from a string.

17. 102-magic_calculation.py: The purpose of this script is to analyze and understand the bytecode of a given Python function.

Each script in this directory addresses a specific problem or demonstrates a particular concept related to conditional statements, loops, and functions in Python programming.
